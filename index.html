          <h1>Day 1-2</h1>
          <p>After a hectic work week, I had the weekend off and spent the
          entire time sleeping or sitting around.</p>

          <p>Usually I’m not one to take naps, but I hardly moved for two days.
          I thought maybe I was overwhelmed and this was my body’s way of
          telling me that I needed a break.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step-2">
          <p>I also had night sweats. Since I have a history of migraines and
          don’t tolerate the heat well, this didn’t seem odd to me. But looking
          back, these were more pronounced than usual.</p>

          <h1>Day 3</h1>
          <p>When I returned to work on Monday, I began to feel faint in the
          middle of a 10-hour shift.</p>

          <p>That morning, I was in full PPE screening patients outside. By
          then, we were seeing close to 200 patients per week. I was halfway
          through the 49 patients I had on my schedule for that day when I
          started feeling off.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step-4">
          <p>From what I can remember, I had just finished seeing a patient when
          I suddenly felt weak and dizzy and got a headache. I held onto the
          roof of the patient’s car for a moment, then slowly walked back to my
          coworkers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step-5">
          <p>My hearing became muffled and I felt like I was in a tunnel, like
          something was closing in on me. According to my coworkers, I became
          pale. I don’t remember much after that.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step-6">
          <p>My colleagues sat me in a chair and checked my vitals. Someone must
          have helped me remove my PPE, and they called my husband to come pick
          me up. I was given a test for COVID-19 “just to rule it out” and was
          told to stay home until I was symptom-free.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step-7">
          <p>Honestly, though, I didn’t think I had the virus. Again, I figured
          that I was just having symptoms of my chronic migraines. After all,
          I’d been fully protected around patients and extremely cautious.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step-8">
          <p>On the ride home, I vaguely remember noticing how empty the highway was, without any sign of life.</p>
