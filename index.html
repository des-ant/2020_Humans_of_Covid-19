          energy up, so I downed a lot of seltzer, tea, and soup.

          <h1>Day 7-10</h1>
          <p>For me, these were the hardest days to get through.</p>

          <p>On April 10, I got a phone call from my office: My test results
          were positive for COVID-19. My husband tested positive for the virus,
          too. He had a cough and sore throat, though his symptoms were much
          milder than mine.</p>

        <div class="step" id="step-4-2">
          <p>I woke up to coughing spells that could last for up to about two
          minutes. In between them, I gasped for air. My throat and chest burned
          with every breath.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step-4-3">
          <p>Each morning, the first thing I did was hurry to the bathroom to
          take a steam bath or shower for about 10 to 15 minutes until my
          coughing stopped.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step-4-4">
          <p>After that and every evening before bed, my husband rubbed Vicks on
          my chest which seemed to help the burning sensation go away. My cough
          pretty much subsided until the next morning, but I still had trouble
          breathing, especially when I tried to walk upstairs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step-4-5">
          <p>In researching the disease, I’d read that some doctors recommended
          breathing exercises to help improve your lung function while you have
          the virus. Knowing this, I forced myself to practice breathing deeply
          (inhaling fully, holding it in, and exhaling as I would in a yoga
          class).

          fade, too. One morning, when my husband rubbed Vicks on my chest, I
          noticed how strong the scent was. Until then, I hadn’t realized I’d
          lost my sense of smell.</p>

          <p>Having COVID-19 was a frightening experience. It’s a very

          <p>Throughout the course of my illness, I never had a fever. While my

          shown any signs of the virus.

          <h3>FACT: Thermal scanners CANNOT detect COVID-19</h3>
          <p>Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have a fever
          (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature). They cannot detect
          people who are infected with COVID-19. There are many causes of fever.
          Call your healthcare provider if you need assistance or seek immediate
          medical care if you have fever and live in an area with malaria or
          dengue (WHO, 2020).</p>

          <h1>Common Symptoms</h1>
          <p>Symptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild illness to pneumonia. Some
