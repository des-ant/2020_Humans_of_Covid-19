          <p>I woke up to coughing spells that could last for up to about two
          minutes. In between them, I gasped for air. My throat and chest burned
          with every breath.</p>

          <p>Each morning, the first thing I did was hurry to the bathroom to
          take a steam bath or shower for about 10 to 15 minutes until my
          coughing stopped.</p>

        <div class="step" id="step-4-4">
          <p>After that and every evening before bed, my husband rubbed Vicks on
          my chest which seemed to help the burning sensation go away. My cough
          pretty much subsided until the next morning, but I still had trouble
          breathing, especially when I tried to walk upstairs.</p>

        <div class="step" id="step-4-5">
          <p>In researching the disease, I’d read that some doctors recommended
          breathing exercises to help improve your lung function while you have
          the virus. Knowing this, I forced myself to practice breathing deeply
          (inhaling fully, holding it in, and exhaling as I would in a yoga
          class).

          people who are infected with COVID-19. There are many causes of fever.

          <p>Symptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild illness to pneumonia. Some
          people will recover easily, and others may get very sick very quickly.

          <ul>
            <li>fever</li>
            <li>respiratory symptoms</li>
            <li>coughing</li>
            <li>sore throat</li>

          sense of taste, loss of appetite and fatigue.</p>
          <p>To stop the spread of COVID-19 people with even mild symptoms of
