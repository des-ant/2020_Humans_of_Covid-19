          <p>After a hectic work week, I had the weekend off and spent the

          <p>I also had night sweats. Since I have a history of migraines and
          don’t tolerate the heat well, this didn’t seem odd to me. But looking

          <p>When I returned to work on Monday, I began to feel faint in the
          middle of a 10-hour shift.</p>

          <p>That morning, I was in full PPE screening patients outside. By
          then, we were seeing close to 200 patients per week. I was halfway
          through the 49 patients I had on my schedule for that day when I
          started feeling off.</p>

        <div class="step" id="step-2-2">
          <p>From what I can remember, I had just finished seeing a patient when
          I suddenly felt weak and dizzy and got a headache. I held onto the
          roof of the patient’s car for a moment, then slowly walked back to my
          coworkers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step-2-3">
          <p>My hearing became muffled and I felt like I was in a tunnel, like
          something was closing in on me. According to my coworkers, I became
          pale. I don’t remember much after that.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step-2-4">
          <p>My colleagues sat me in a chair and checked my vitals. Someone must
          have helped me remove my PPE, and they called my husband to come pick
          me up. I was given a test for COVID-19 “just to rule it out” and was
          told to stay home until I was symptom-free.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step-2-5">
          <p>Honestly, though, I didn’t think I had the virus. Again, I figured
          that I was just having symptoms of my chronic migraines. After all,
          I’d been fully protected around patients and extremely cautious.</p>

          <p>After I got home, I self-isolated in my bedroom. My husband and I have three children, and my mother and husband’s niece also lives with us. My kids had seen how bad my migraines could get, so they just assumed I was having another really bad one.</p>

          <p>My body just wanted to lay down and not move, but my husband made it his mission to help me fight the virus. I was sure at this point he’d already been exposed, but we still did our best to keep our family safe.</p>

          <p>He insisted on staying with me to monitor my breathing, so we both wore surgical face masks. Every night, he slept on the floor beside our bed. I hardly got up for the next four days.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step-3-5">
          <p>My symptoms were the most severe in the mornings. It was the weirdest thing. I’d sleep really well—six to eight hours a night, which is the norm for me. But once I sat up and tried to get out of bed, I started coughing and had a hard time breathing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step-3-6">
          <p>Every time I tried to take a deep breath, I felt a burning sensation in my throat and chest. This wasn’t like the kind of soreness you get from strep throat or heartburn. I felt as if I was inhaling hot air that scratched me up inside.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step-3-7">
          <p>I didn’t have much of an appetite for solid food and ended up losing a total of eight pounds during the course of my illness. My husband told me I had to drink and eat because I needed to keep my energy up, so I downed a lot of seltzer, tea, and soup.

          <p>On April 10, I got a phone call from my office: My test results were positive for COVID-19. My husband tested positive for the virus, too. He had a cough and sore throat, though his symptoms were much milder than mine.</p>

          <p>I woke up to coughing spells that could last for up to about two minutes. In between them, I gasped for air. My throat and chest burned with every breath.</p>

          <p>Each morning, the first thing I did was hurry to the bathroom to take a steam bath or shower for about 10 to 15 minutes until my coughing stopped.</p>

        <div class="step" id="step-4-4">
          <p>After that and every evening before bed, my husband rubbed Vicks on my chest which seemed to help the burning sensation go away. My cough pretty much subsided until the next morning, but I still had trouble breathing, especially when I tried to walk upstairs.</p>

        <div class="step" id="step-4-5">
          <p>In researching the disease, I’d read that some doctors recommended breathing exercises to help improve your lung function while you have the virus. Knowing this, I forced myself to practice breathing deeply (inhaling fully, holding it in, and exhaling as I would in a yoga class).

          <p>Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature). They cannot detect people who are infected with COVID-19.

          <p>Symptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild illness to pneumonia. Some
          people will recover easily, and others may get very sick very quickly.
          People with coronavirus may experience symptoms such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>fever</li>
            <li>respiratory symptoms</li>
            <li>coughing</li>
            <li>sore throat</li>
            <li>shortness of breath</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Other symptoms can include runny nose, headache, muscle or joint
          pains, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, loss of sense of smell, altered
          sense of taste, loss of appetite and fatigue.</p>
          <p>To stop the spread of COVID-19 people with even mild symptoms of respiratory infection should get tested.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>attend a free COVID-19 respiratory clinic</li>
            <li>contact your doctor and they will arrange the test, this may attract a fee</li>
          </ul>
          <p>COVID-19 respiratory clinics are dedicated health centres located around the country, focusing on testing people with symptoms of respiratory infection.
          </p>
